# Volcano Dashboard

## Overview

The Volcano Dashboard provides a web-based user interface to monitor and manage resources in your Volcano-enabled Kubernetes cluster. This dashboard allows you to visualize and interact with Volcano jobs, queues, pods, and other related resources, making it easier to monitor workload status and troubleshoot issues.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Volcano Dashboard, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster** - A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.16+)
2. **kubectl** - The Kubernetes command-line tool, configured to communicate with your cluster
3. **Node.js** - Installed on your local development system if you plan to contribute or modify the dashboard
4. **Visual Studio Code** - Recommended IDE for development (optional)
5. **Volcano Scheduler** - Volcano must be installed in your cluster prior to setting up the dashboard

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Volcano Scheduler

The Volcano Dashboard requires Volcano to be installed first. Follow these steps to install Volcano:

1. Visit the [Volcano Installation Guide](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/installation/) for detailed instructions
2. Alternatively, you can install Volcano with the following commands:

```bash
# Download the latest Volcano release
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/volcano/master/installer/volcano-development.yaml

# Verify the installation
$ kubectl get pods -n volcano-system
```

Make sure all Volcano components are running successfully before proceeding.

### Step 2: Install Volcano Dashboard

Once Volcano is properly installed and running, you can deploy the Volcano Dashboard:

1. Create a dedicated namespace for the dashboard:

```bash
kubectl create ns volcano-system
```

2. Deploy the dashboard:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/dashboard/main/deployment/volcano-dashboard.yaml
```

3. Map the dashboard service to make it accessible:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/volcano-dashboard 8080:80 -n volcano-system --address 0.0.0.0
```

### Step 3: Access the Dashboard

Access the dashboard by navigating to:
- If running on your local machine: http://localhost:8080
- If running on a remote server: http://${YOUR_NODE_IP}:8080
