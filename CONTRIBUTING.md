ðŸš€ For dashboard setup, see the [Getting Started](./README.md#getting-started) section in README.

### Prerequisites

Please follow the [guide](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano#quick-start-guide) to install volcano first.

### Install volcano dashboard

Login one node of your kubernetes cluster and execute the following command to install volcano dashboard.

```bash
kubectl create ns volcano-system

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/dashboard/main/deployment/volcano-dashboard.yaml
```

Then use the following command to map the traffic to node.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/volcano-dashboard 8080:80 -n volcano-system --address 0.0.0.0
```

Access the dashboard by navigate to `http://$YOUR_NODE_IP:8080` in your browser.

If running locally navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Development

1. First of all, `fork` this repo.
2. Next -> clone your branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/dashboard.git
```

`note`: replace `<your-user-name>` with your github username.

3. Move to cloned dir and if you want to make changes to our codebase then create new branch

```bash
cd dashboard/

git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

4. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script)

5. Use similar version

```bash
nvm use
```

6. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

7. Run the `dev` script

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Inside kubernetes cluster

You can build the volcano dashboard images locally. Please use the following command to build docker images of volcano dashboard.

Build images.

```bash
// build frontend image.
docker build -t frontend:dev . -f deployment/build/frontend/Dockerfile
// build backend image.
docker build -t backend:dev . -f deployment/build/backend/Dockerfile
```

After that you can replace the images in `volcano-dashboard.yaml` to verify the result.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment/volcano-dashboard.yaml
```

## Code Style and Standards
